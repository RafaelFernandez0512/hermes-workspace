## Description: <br>
Lsp Assist integrates the Language Server Protocol for OpenClaw agents so they can navigate code, inspect types, find references, report diagnostics, and search symbols in TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python projects. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Publisher: <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT-0 <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and coding agents use this skill when grep is not precise enough for code navigation, type inspection, diagnostics, reference lookup, or workspace symbol search. It supports one-shot queries for quick checks and daemon mode for repeated language-server queries during an editing session. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Daemon mode is open on localhost when it is started without an authentication token. <br>
Mitigation: In shared, remote, container, or multi-user environments, start daemon mode with --token and send requests with the matching Bearer token. <br>
Risk: The language server can inspect files inside the configured project root. <br>
Mitigation: Set --root to only the project directory that should be available for code navigation. <br>
